# Portfolio Webpage
I've built this project of my personal portfolio by creating and hosting it entirely on **HTML** along with some basic inline styles for formatting. It serves as a digital resume that showcases my technical background, projects, skills, hobbies and ways to contact me.

### Project Overview 
The project consists of a multi-page static website structured with:

- ðŸŽ¯ `index.html` â†’ My resume with sections like Summary, Education, Skills, Projects, and links to hobbies & contact pages.
- ðŸ“¬ `contact.html` â†’ Provides clickable icons to reach me via LinkedIn, Email, and GitHub.
- ðŸŽ¨ `hobbies.html` â†’ A fun section about what I enjoy outside of coding.

### Built With

- **HTML5** (with basic inline styles)
- No CSS files, JavaScript, or frameworks used
- Local image assets (logos, profile pic)
