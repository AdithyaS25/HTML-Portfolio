# Portfolio Webpage
This is my personal portfolio website, originally created entirely with HTML and inline CSS. Over time, Iâ€™ve updated it to use modern CSS styling techniques for better structure, maintainability, and visual appeal. It acts as a digital resume, presenting my technical expertise, projects, skills, personal interests, and contact details in a clear and organized manner.

### Project Overview 
This is a multi-page static website, currently structured as:

- ðŸŽ¯ `index.html` â†’  Resume homepage with sections like Summary, Education, Skills, Projects, and links to hobbies & contact pages.
- ðŸ“¬ `contact.html` â†’ Provides clickable icons to reach me via LinkedIn, Email, and GitHub.
- ðŸŽ¨ `hobbies.html` â†’ A fun section about what I enjoy outside of coding.
- ðŸŽ¥ `movie-ranking.html` â†’ A small project that lists my personal top 3 favorite movies with a simple and clean layout.
- ðŸŽ‰ `birthday-invite.html` â†’ A fun and creative birthday invitation page built using HTML and CSS basics.
- ðŸŽ¨ `style.css` â†’ Defines the visual appearance of all pages such as background colors, fonts, layouts ensuring a clean design across the entire site.

### Built With :

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling (external stylesheets now used instead of inline styles)
- No JavaScript or frameworks - just clean, hand-written code
- Local image assets (logos, profile pic)

ðŸŽ¯ Improvements from the Original Version :
- Switched from inline CSS to external CSS files for better scalability and cleaner code.
- Added background colors, improved typography, layout enhancements, and visual consistency.
- Structured styling for better reusability and maintenance across all pages.

ðŸš€ Goals Ahead :
- Add responsive design for better mobile compatibility.
- Integrate CSS animations and hover effects.
- Explore adding JavaScript interactivity in future iterations.
