# Portfolio Webpage
This portfolio website was created and hosted entirely using **HTML**, with basic inline styling for formatting. It acts as a digital resume, presenting my technical expertise, projects, skills, personal interests, and contact details in a clear and organized manner.

### Project Overview 
The project consists of a multi-page static website structured with:

- ðŸŽ¯ `index.html` â†’ My resume with sections like Summary, Education, Skills, Projects, and links to hobbies & contact pages.
- ðŸ“¬ `contact.html` â†’ Provides clickable icons to reach me via LinkedIn, Email, and GitHub.
- ðŸŽ¨ `hobbies.html` â†’ A fun section about what I enjoy outside of coding.
